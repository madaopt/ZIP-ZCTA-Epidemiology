# ZIP Code and ZIP Code Tabulation Area Linkage: Implications for Bias in Epidemiological Research

Welcome, this page is for our publication in *Epidemiology*; [citation coming up soon]
 
The paper uses public data and data obtained from IPUMS (http://doi.org/10.18128/D050.V18.0). IPUMS does not allow redistribution but is publicly available. The data citation in the main article has the full URL. UDS crosswalk data link was redirected to another website in April, 2024, and users can no longer see historical crosswalks. We pre-downloaded those files and shared in under **Raw Data**. In addition, please find our code for data cleaning and analysis.

## File directory

* Raw Data: List **websites** of shareable raw data we used; "Crosswalk" folder contains a processed file (*UDS_corsswalk_till2022.rds*), and the raw crosswalk files downloaded from UDS
* Example_use crosswalk.R: sample code for using crosswalk files, though researchers can devise other creative ways to summarize their data
* Main analysis.R: Analysis code for the manuscript (including revision & response to reviewers).
* Combine UDS files_CA.R: Code used to check UDS crosswalk and combine longitudinal years into one file. Processed longitudinal crosswalk for CA is included in *Raw Data/Crosswalk/UDS_corsswalk_till2022.rds*
